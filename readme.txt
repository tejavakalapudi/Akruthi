##IMPORTANT : CONSISTENTLY CHECKING IF THERE"S A WAY TO BUNDLE BOOTSTRAP BEFORE CUSTOM CSS THROUGH WEBPACK ##
1. Have sticky header and apply z-index during scroll
2. Contact us (Clicking on icons should dynamically modify the contact us form)
3. Should toggle font size and background color
4. Somehow set up a bot
5. Learn tests section and have library test driven
6. Make sure we watch test related videos in firebase-with-redux section
7. Also test database section
8. Page should load from top always
9. Transparent black background behind header nav bar
